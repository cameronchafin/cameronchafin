# Hey, I'm Cameron ‚úåÔ∏è

#### I'm a current Postbacc CS student at Oregon State University

As a former professional photographer, I am deeply creative and inquisitive. I fell in love with coding because I feel it allows me to flex my creativity while also tapping into my love for problem solving and logic. I love the challenge that coding provides and the excitement of getting buried in a new project. As a CS student, I enjoy being exposed to so many different technologies and concepts of computer science and I can't wait to do what I can to try to make the world a little better through code as a software engineer.

## üë®‚Äçüíª What I'm Currently Focused On...

After completing my first year of my CS degree, I am taking the summer to focus on honing my web development skills, building personal projects, and applying for internships for summer 2024.

  <summary><h3>üëæ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  Growing up in Texas, I always thought my dream was to travel the world working as a freelance photographer. It seemed set in stone upon receiving B.A in fine arts. My itch for adventure took me around the world to New Zealand, South America, and across Asia where I landed in South Korea and eventually began my career as an English teacher. I fell in love with education and threw myself into my work, but after a few years, I felt like something was missing. I craved a new challenge and room for growth that a new career path could bring. 

Recognizing my lifelong interest and curiosity in computers, I tried a Python tutorial at FreeCodeCamp. From the first time I saw "Hello World" in my console, it was love at first sight. I decided if I was going to do this, I would go all in and get a formal degree in computer science. 

I struck gold when I began attending Oregon State University as a CS Postbacc student. My courses have pushed me to grow, ignited my love for problem solving and critical thinking, and fulfilled me in a way I've never experienced in my professional career. Coding has allowed me to merge my creativity with analytical thinking and approach a variety of problems where I can tinker my way to innovative solutions.
